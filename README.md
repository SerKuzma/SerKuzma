- âš¡ Fun fact: In 1999, NASA accidentally lost a $125 million Mars orbiter
    because one engineering team used metric units while another used English units 
    for a key spacecraft operation. This miscommunication caused the orbiter to approach Mars 
    at the wrong angle and ultimately led to its failure. 
    This incident serves as a humorous reminder of the importance of consistent units and effective
    communication in engineering and programming projects!
